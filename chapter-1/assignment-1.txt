Q1. What is Emmet?
Ans. Emmet is a free add-on for your text editor. It allows you to type shortcuts that are then expanded into full pieces of code.
By using Emmet, developers type less, they save both on keystrokes and time.

Q2. Difference between library and framework
Ans. Technical difference between library and framework lies in a term called 'inversion of control'.
**Inversion of Control** is a design principle that allows classes to be loosely coupled and, therefore, easier to test and maintain.
IoC refers to transferring the control of objects and their dependencies from the main program to a container or framework.

# Framework

    - It is like building a model home. You have a set of blueprints and a few limited choices when it comes to architecture and design.
    Ultimately, the contractor and blueprint are in control. And they will let you know when and where you can provide your input.

    - It comprises of lot of APIs, compilers, support programs, libraries etc.
    
    - When you use a framework, the framework is in charge of the flow. It provides some places for you to plug in your code,
    but it calls the code you plugged in as needed.

    - A framework development requires a lot of code that decrease performance and increase the load time.
    
    - It is difficult to replace frameworks.
    
    - Including framework smoothly into an existing project is impossible.
    
    - Its example are AngularJs, Spring, etc.

# Library

    - It is like You already have a home, but you need a bit of help with furniture.
    
    - It is a collection of helper modules, classes, objects, functions, pre-written code, etc.
    
    - When you use a library, you are in charge of the flow of the application. You are choosing when and where to call the library.
    
    - Building a library requires less code, so there is better performance and fast load time.
    
    - A library is easy to be replaced with another library.
    
    - Libraries can be integrated easily into existing projects to add some specific functionality.
    
    - Its example are JQuery, ReactJs, etc.

Q3. What is CDN?
Ans.

# A group of servers spread out over a region or around the world that work together to speed up content delivery on the web.

The servers in a CDN temporarily store(or cache) webpage content like HTML pages, javascript files, stylesheets, images, and videos.

Benefits:
better performance, increased reliability, cost savings, and resilience against cyber attacks.

Q4. Why is React known as React?
Ans. React was designed to allow developers to "react" to changes in state and data within an application.

Q5. What is crossorigin in script tag?
Ans. Provides support for CORS i.e, defining how the element handles cross-origin requests.

Q6. What is diference between React and ReactDOM?
Ans. React library is responsible for building user interfaces and ReactDOM library allows React to interact with the DOM
i.e, render UI in the browser.

Q7. What is difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?
Ans. 
- Development mode includes useful warnings and gives you access to tools that make development and debugging easier. 
- Production mode minifies your code and better represents the performance your app will have on end users devices.

Note: development build is slower than the production build

Q8. What is async and defer?
Ans.

# Async

- script is downloaded asynchronously without pausing HTML parsing. Once the script downloaded parsing will be paused and the script's execution will happen.
when execution done parsing will resume.

# Defer

- It tells the browser not to interfere with HTML parsing and execute the script file once the HTML document fully parsed.
in this also script is downloaded asynchronously.
